# javascript-kata

## Introduction

Starting point for doing a code kata, using [node.js][node] and 
[jasmine-node][jasmn] which is a 'port' of the [jasmine][jasm] behavior 
driven development framework for testing javascript code.

## What's in it?

This directory contains the following:

- `README.md`, you're currently reading it.
- `bootstrap.bat`, a wrapper around bootstrap.ps1 for those how run [PowerShell][ps] 
  with the Restricted or AllSigned, ExecutionPolicy.
- `bootstrap.ps1`
    - installs chocolatey if not already installed
    - installs nodejs.install chocolatey package
    - installs node package jasmine-node plus it's dependencies
    - installs jshint plus it's dependencies
    - installs node-inspector plus it's dependencies

  Note that this script needs an internet connection to function.

- `check.bat` a script that invokes jshint on the current directory.
- `check.ps1` a script that can take advantage of the [pswatch][psw] module,
  such that jshint can be run whenever a javascript file changes on the 
  filesystem.
- `debug.bat` a scripts that starts a debugging session using node-inspector,
  you have to supply the name of the spec you wish to debug. Be sure to add a
  `debugger;` statement to your spec where you want to break.
- `example.js`, example javascript file containing your production code.
- `example.spec.js`, example javascript file containing a single 
  specification.
- `LICENSE`, a copy of the license that applies to this repository, which is 
  the [GNU General Public License version 3][gplv3] or later.
- `run.bat`, run and watch the specs. Watch the specs means that the filesystem 
  will be watched for modifications to `.js` files and as soon as changes are 
  detected the specs will be run.

## Ubuntu-howto

### Install node package manager

    sudo apt-get install npm

### Set global registry for npm

    npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/

### Install packages using npm

#### Install packages globally

    sudo npm install jasmine-node -g
    sudo npm install jshint -g
    sudo npm install node-inspector -g

#### Install packages as a user 

##### This will install the packages in `<some dir>/node_modules`

    cd <some dir>
    npm install jasmine-node
    npm install jshint
    npm install node-inspector
    
    export PATH=`pwd`/.bin:$PATH
